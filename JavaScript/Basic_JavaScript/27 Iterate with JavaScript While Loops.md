You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

```js

const ourArray = [];

let i = 0;

  

while (i < 5) {

  ourArray.push(i);

  i++;

}

```

In the code example above, the while loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to ourArray.

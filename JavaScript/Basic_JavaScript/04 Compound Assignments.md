It is really common to use assignments to modify variables, e.g.:

```js

myVar = myVar + 5;

```

So a shorter way of writing this is:

```js

myVar += 5;

```

Similarly, -= will subtract.

```js

myVar -=5; == myVar = myVar = 5;

```

and *=

```js

myVar *= 5;

```

and /=

```js

myVar /= 5;

```

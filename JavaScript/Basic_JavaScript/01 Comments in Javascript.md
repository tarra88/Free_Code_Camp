Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:
 
Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:
 
```javascript

// This is an in-line comment.

```

You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */. This is a multi-line comment:

```js

/* This is a

multi-line comment */

```

It appears that both "javascript" and "js" work in markdown to label code as JavaScript.

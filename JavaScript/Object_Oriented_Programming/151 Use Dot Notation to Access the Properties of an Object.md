The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
```

Dot notation is used on the object name, `duck`, followed by the name of the property, `name`, to access the value of `Aflac`.

`import` allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load. In the previous lesson, the examples exported `add` from the `math_functions.js` file. Here's how you can import it to use in another file:

```js
import { add } from './math_functions.js';
```

Here, `import` will find `add` in `math_functions.js`, import just that function for you to use, and ignore the rest. The `./` tells the import to look for the `math_functions.js` file in the same folder as the current file. The relative file path (`./`) and file extension (`.js`) are required when using import in this way.

You can import more than one item from the file by adding them in the `import` statement like this:

```js
import { add, subtract } from './math_functions.js';
```

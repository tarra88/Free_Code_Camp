Here's the `Bird` constructor from the previous challenge:

```js
function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color  = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let blueBird = new Bird();
```

**NOTE:** `this` inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.

Notice that the `new` operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of `Bird` called `blueBird`. Without the `new` operator, `this` inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now `blueBird` has all the properties defined inside the `Bird` constructor:

```js
blueBird.name;
blueBird.color;
blueBird.numLegs;
```

Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:

```js
blueBird.name = 'Elvira';
blueBird.name;
```

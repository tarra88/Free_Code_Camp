If you are unfamiliar with const, check out this challenge about the `const` keyword.

The `const` declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using `const` by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use `let`.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using `const` are still mutable. Using the `const` declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

```js

const s = [5, 6, 7];

s = [1, 2, 3];

s[2] = 45;

console.log(s);

```

`s = [1, 2, 3]` will result in an error. After commenting out that line, the `console.log` will display the value `[5, 6, 45]`.
